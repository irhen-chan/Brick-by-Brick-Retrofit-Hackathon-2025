## 📌 Project Overview  
*Bricking Bad* is a retrofit design proposal for the **120 Racecourse Road, Flemington** public housing tower.  
Our aim was to reimagine social housing through **equity, passive sustainability, and dignity in design**.  

The project addresses critical issues of:  
- **Thermal inequity** – residents endure extreme summer overheating and winter cold stress.  
- **Energy burden** – low-income households face disproportionately high energy costs.  
- **Community wellbeing** – limited green space, poor ventilation, and dated layouts reduce liveability.

## 🎯 Hackathon Brief  
Teams were asked to retrofit the Flemington social housing tower with:  

### Design  
- Standard two-bedroom apartment floorplan & section  
- Standard level floorplan (2- & 3-bedroom zones)  
- Community & laundry spaces  

### Envelope  
- Improved thermal performance  
- Sustainable materials board  
- Detailed wall section of retrofitted façade  

### Energy  
- Efficient appliance selection  
- Energy demand calculations for apartments & full building  
- PV system design (output, panel placement, orientation, storage, cost)  
- Energy-efficient lighting plan  

### Presentation  
- Clear visuals, diagrams, and communication of design intent  
- Strong integration of passive design principles  

**Judging criteria focused on:** design suitability, sustainability, thermal performance, energy efficiency, creativity, and presentation clarity.

## 🔎 Site Context & Data-Backed Pain Points  
We grounded our design in **data-driven research**:  

- **Climate Data (2013–2022)** – On average:  
  - 10+ hot days ≥30 °C each summer month  
  - 3–4 very hot days ≥35 °C in peak summer  
  - 7–9 cold nights ≤5 °C each winter month  
  - → Confirms dual seasonal discomfort (overheating + underheating).  

- **Urban Heat Island (UHI)** – Flemington towers sit in a **+9–10 °C hotspot** vs rural baseline.  

- **Vegetation Analysis** – Site has **28.5% total vegetation cover**, with only ~5% tall canopy vs ~10% metro average.  

- **Demographics** –  
  - Family-dominated households but **weekly incomes less than half the state average**.  
  - Highlights the economic disadvantage that magnifies energy burdens.

## 🛠️ Design Response  

### Envelope Retrofit  
- Hemp insulation panels + breathable cladding system  
- Enhanced fenestration for daylighting & cross-ventilation  
- Living green façade + rooftop gardens  

### Energy & Systems  
- All-electric kitchens (induction stoves)  
- Shared laundry & storage hubs to reduce appliance load  
- PV system sized for building’s projected energy demand  
- Passive cooling: cross-ventilation, ceiling fans (no AC reliance)  
- Energy-efficient lighting plan integrated into apartment layouts  

### Community-Centric Spaces  
- Semi-private balconies + widened shared corridors  
- Flexible communal areas for social/market use  
- Green rooftop garden & low-canopy tree planting for microclimates  
- Spaces inspired by **Oldenburg’s “Third Place” theory** for social connection

## 🌱 Key Takeaways  
- Retrofitting social housing is not just a technical challenge — it’s about **equity, dignity, and resilience**.  
- **Data + Design** = stronger solutions. Evidence-based pain points directly informed our retrofit strategies.  
- Hackathons push rapid innovation, but grounding every idea in **research-backed justification** made our proposal stand out.
